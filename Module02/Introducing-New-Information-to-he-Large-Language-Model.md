# 🚀 Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT – Learning Journey by Ishrat
👋🏼 Welcome to my Prompt Engineering learning log!  
This repo documents my hands-on progress through the Coursera course "**Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT**" by Vanderbilt University.  
I’m a passionate mom of 2, and self-taught coder (Day 47 💻) — using AI to build my confidence, creativity, and future-readiness.


## 📚 Module 2: Prompt Patterns (Completed ✅)

### 💡 What I Learned
In this module, I explored 16 practical prompt design patterns that help improve the clarity, tone, and effectiveness of conversations with ChatGPT.
