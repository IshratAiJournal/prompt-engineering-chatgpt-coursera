⚙️ Module 6: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting

🤖 What It’s About

Using prompt patterns and memory/state management to build LLM applications that not only "think" but also "do" — e.g., answer questions while tracking changes, planning tasks, or keeping a list.

🧩 Techniques Introduced

1. Program-aided Prompting (PAP)

LLM reasons, then uses a program (like a calculator or code) to act.

Ideal for tasks needing exact calculations.

2. Action Plans

LLM creates a step-by-step plan before acting.

Example: making a sandwich, or solving a logic puzzle.

3. State Tracking

AI remembers past actions or states.

Useful for multi-step tasks like chat-based agents or checklists.

📦 Prompt Pattern Example

User: Add milk to grocery list.

AI: Added milk. Anything else? [Keeps memory of the list.]

🛠 Prompt Pattern Templates

These patterns can be combined with CoT prompting:

Tail Generation: At end of reply, repeat key points or ask for next action.

Menu Actions: If user types X, do Y. Add rules and ask for next action.

Outline Expansion: Expand 1 bullet → turn it into a deeper outline.

Fact Checklist: Summarize core facts and check them at the end.

🚀 Takeaway

Modules 5 & 6 shift you from writing good prompts to engineering intelligent workflows, where the model can think, reason, act, and manage ongoing tasks or plans.

Next step? Use these patterns to build prompt-based applications — agents, planners, assistants — and evaluate them! Let me know when you're ready.
